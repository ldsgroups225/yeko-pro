### 2. Layout Components
- **`_components/CashierLayoutClient.tsx`** - Main layout wrapper with glassmorphism background and modal management
- **`_components/CashierLayoutServer.tsx`** - Server-side layout wrapper for authentication
- **`_components/CashierNavbar.tsx`** - Navigation bar with action buttons and user info

### 3. Modal Components

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions
- **Loading States**: Suspense boundaries for better UX

### üí≥ Payment Management
- **Student Search**: Find students by name or matriculation number via modal
- **Payment Recording**: Record payments directly in modal with student context

### üìä Analytics & Reporting
- **Daily Stats**: Collections, transaction count, student metrics
- **Payment Methods**: Breakdown by cash, mobile money, bank transfers
- **Hourly Distribution**: Visual chart of payment timing
- **End-of-Day Reports**: Comprehensive daily summaries in modal

### üîê Security
- **Role-Based Access**: Cashier role verification
- **Cached Authentication**: Performance-optimized auth checks
- **School Context**: Data scoped to authenticated user's school

## Technical Implementation

### Server Components
- Most components are server-rendered for optimal performance
- Data fetching happens on the server using Supabase
- React cache used for authentication to prevent redundant queries

### Client Interactivity
- Modal components are client-side for real-time interactions
- Debounced search with loading states
- Form interactions and animations
- State management for modal visibility and selected students

### Data Flow
1. Authentication verified on each request
2. User and school context loaded once per request (cached)
3. Dashboard data fetched in parallel
4. Modal interactions handled client-side with server actions
5. Components render with real data and proper fallbacks

## User Experience

### Navigation
- **Single Page**: All functionality accessible from main dashboard
- **Action Buttons**: Primary actions in navbar with icons and tooltips
- **Modal Workflows**: Seamless transitions between search ‚Üí payment ‚Üí report
- **Context Preservation**: Selected student maintained across modal interactions

### Workflows
1. **Student Search**: Click "Rechercher un √©l√®ve" ‚Üí Search modal opens
2. **Payment Recording**: Click "Nouveau paiement" ‚Üí Payment modal opens (with student if selected)
3. **Report Generation**: Click "G√©n√©rer rapport" ‚Üí Report modal opens
4. **Quick Access**: All actions available from navbar without page navigation

## Usage

The dashboard provides cashiers with:
1. **Quick Overview**: Daily stats and recent activity on main page
2. **Fast Actions**: Direct access to common tasks via navbar
3. **Modal Workflows**: Focused interactions without losing context
4. **Daily Reporting**: End-of-day summaries and analytics in modal

## Integration Points

The dashboard integrates with:
- **Supabase Database**: For all data operations
- **Authentication System**: Role-based access control
- **Payment Services**: Existing payment processing logic
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with modals and tooltips

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
1. Real-time notifications for new payments
2. Export functionality for reports
3. Advanced filtering options in search modal
4. Integration with receipt printing
5. Mobile-optimized payment recording interface
6. Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Development Notes

- All components follow TypeScript best practices
- Error handling implemented throughout
- Accessibility considerations in place
- Consistent naming conventions
- Modular and reusable component structure
- Modal state management optimized for user experience
